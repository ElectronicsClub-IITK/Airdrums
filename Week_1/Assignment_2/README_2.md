# Week 1 - Assignment 2
This is your second assignment in the summer project. 
This assignment is to make you familiar with basic signal processing concepts and pre-processing techniques, namely FFT, DFT and Filtering techniques.

## Instructions
1. Implement FFT, DFT and any simple filter of your choice in Python.
2. Make sure to properly comment each and every line of code you write.
3. For implementing the code for filter, a noisy signal is provided to you on whatsapp. You will have to filter this signal and plot both the unfiltered and filtered signal using matplotlib.
4. Test the functions FFT and DFT on the input provided to you.
5. Name the python file as YourName_Assignment2.
6. Generate a pull request and submit the assignment.
