# Assignment - 3 [TinkerCad]
This assignment is to introduce and develop your Arduino coding skills. This assignment will be done on TinkerCad. 
## Instructions
1. Go through the resources doc shared on Whatsapp, a playlist on Arduino has been added. Please go through that playlist before attempting the assignment.
2. IF you do not have a TinkerCad account then create one using your IITK Email ID.
3. Go to (+Create) and select Circuits to create a new circuit.
4. Create a circuit on TinkerCad which uses I2C communication to display the temperature on a LCD Display. [Hint: You need to use 2 Arduinos]
5. DO NOT use the I2C LCD Display. Please make the circuit using the normal 16x2 LCD Display.
6. Download the circuit (as PNG) and the code file (as a .ino file) and place it in a folder called name_assignment3 and make a pull request.
