# Week 3 Assignment 4
Instructions:
1. Write a Python function to calculate the displacement vector of an object given its acceleration vectors at regular time intervals, assuming constant acceleration between consecutive intervals.
2. You have to take current displacement, current velocity, given acceleration, and time interval (100ms) as function arguments and update the current velocity and displacement vectors.
3. You can assume that acceleration was constant in the given interval.
